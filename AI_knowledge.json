    "Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the field of computer science that focuses on creating systems capable of performing tasks that normally require human intelligence. These tasks include learning from data, reasoning, problem-solving, understanding natural language, and even perception such as recognizing images or speech.",
    "The goal of AI is to make machines think and act intelligently, similar to humans, and in some cases, even better.",
    "The term Artificial Intelligence was first coined by John McCarthy in 1956 at the Dartmouth Conference, which is considered the birth of AI as a formal discipline.",
    "1940s–1950s: Early work on symbolic reasoning and simple automata. Alan Turing proposed the idea of a 'thinking machine' and the famous Turing Test to check machine intelligence.",
    "1956: Dartmouth Conference – birth of AI, with researchers like John McCarthy, Marvin Minsky, Herbert Simon, and Allen Newell.",
    "1960s–1970s: AI programs developed for problem-solving and game playing, such as solving algebra or playing chess.",
    "1980s: Expert Systems became popular – rule-based systems used in medicine, finance, and engineering.",
    "1997: IBM’s Deep Blue defeated world chess champion Garry Kasparov.",
    "2010s–present: The rise of Machine Learning and Deep Learning has led to breakthroughs in speech recognition, computer vision, and generative AI like ChatGPT and DALL·E.",
    "AI can be categorized into types based on capability and functionality.",
    "Narrow AI (Weak AI) is designed to perform a specific task. Example: Chatbots, recommendation systems, voice assistants.",
    "General AI (Strong AI) is hypothetical AI that can perform any intellectual task a human can. It is still a research goal and not achieved yet.",
    "Super AI is a future concept where machines surpass human intelligence completely. It could outperform humans in creativity, emotions, and problem-solving.",
    "Applications of AI include Healthcare, Finance, Education, Transportation, Entertainment, Customer Service, Agriculture, and Manufacturing.",
    "Advantages of AI include Automation, Speed and Accuracy, 24/7 Availability, Data Handling, and Assisting in Dangerous Tasks.",
    "Challenges and Risks of AI include High Cost, Job Displacement, Bias, Ethical Concerns, and Dependency on machines.",
    "The future of AI includes more integration in daily life, improved human-AI collaboration, advances in Explainable AI, potential development of Artificial General Intelligence, and ethical and legal frameworks to regulate AI use."
