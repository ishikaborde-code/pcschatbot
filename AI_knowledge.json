      "answer": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a field of computer science focused on building machines that can perform tasks requiring human intelligence, such as learning, reasoning, problem-solving, and understanding language. The term AI was first introduced by John McCarthy in 1956 at the Dartmouth Conference."

      ],
      "answer": "The history of AI began in the 1940s–1950s with early work on symbolic reasoning. In 1956, the Dartmouth Conference marked the birth of AI as a discipline. Important milestones include the Turing Test, the rise of Expert Systems in the 1980s, IBM Deep Blue defeating Garry Kasparov in 1997, and the growth of machine learning and deep learning in the 2010s."
