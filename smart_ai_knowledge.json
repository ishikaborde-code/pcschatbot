      "topic": "introduction to ai",
      "answer": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the field of computer science that focuses on creating systems capable of performing tasks that normally require human intelligence, including learning from data, reasoning, problem-solving, understanding natural language, and perception such as recognizing images or speech. The term AI was first coined by John McCarthy in 1956 at the Dartmouth Conference."
    },
    {
      "topic": "history of ai",
      "answer": "The history of AI began in the 1940s–1950s with early work on symbolic reasoning and simple automata. Alan Turing proposed the 'Turing Test'. In 1956, the Dartmouth Conference marked the birth of AI. Key milestones include AI programs in 1960s–1970s, Expert Systems in the 1980s, IBM Deep Blue defeating Garry Kasparov in 1997, and the rise of Machine Learning and Deep Learning in 2010s leading to speech recognition, self-driving cars, and generative AI."

    {
      "topic": "types of ai",
      "answer": "AI can be categorized by capability and functionality. Based on capability: Narrow AI (task-specific), General AI (human-level, hypothetical), and Super AI (future concept surpassing human intelligence). Based on functionality: Reactive Machines (no memory), Limited Memory (uses past experience), Theory of Mind AI (understands emotions, in research), and Self-Aware AI (conscious machines, theoretical)."

    {
      "topic": "applications of ai",
      "answer": "AI is used in healthcare (disease detection, medical imaging, robotic surgeries), finance (fraud detection, algorithmic trading, customer support), education (personalized learning, AI tutors), transportation (self-driving cars, traffic management), entertainment (recommendation systems, game bots), customer service (chatbots, virtual assistants), agriculture (smart farming, crop monitoring), and manufacturing (predictive maintenance, quality inspection)."
    },
    {
      "topic": "advantages of ai",
      "answer": "AI offers automation of repetitive tasks, high speed and accuracy, 24/7 availability, data handling on large scales, and assistance in dangerous tasks like mining, bomb disposal, or space exploration."
    },
    {
      "topic": "challenges and risks of ai",
      "answer": "Challenges include high cost of development, potential job displacement, bias from training data, ethical concerns (privacy, transparency, misuse), and over-dependence on AI reducing human critical thinking."
    },
    {
      "topic": "future of ai",
      "answer": "The future of AI includes deeper integration in daily life, improved human-AI collaboration, advances in Explainable AI, potential development of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), and creation of ethical and legal frameworks to regulate AI use."
    },
    {
      "topic": "conclusion",
      "answer": "Artificial Intelligence is a transformative technology that has evolved from mid-20th century symbolic reasoning to modern machine learning and AI applications. It brings many benefits but also raises ethical, fairness, and control challenges. The journey of AI is ongoing and will shape human-machine coexistence."
